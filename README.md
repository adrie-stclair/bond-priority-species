This project is an example of my work in manipulating and cleaning data. 

The goal was to create a list of plant and animal species found within my region that fit within a few parameters of conservation status, resulting in a list of species with priority for conservation. 


This folder contains all of the data and code used to create our Bond 3 Measures of Success plant species list. 

- The final priority species list can be found in the "04_results" folder and is named "Bond priority species.xlsx"
  This table shouldn't be edited outside of formatting. Any meaningful edits should instead be made to the .rmd file in the 01_code folder.
  Editing the RMD will allow the work to stay current and reproducible.

- To view a narrative description of the process, feel free to view the HTML output on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/adrie-stclair/bond-priority-species/blob/main/01_code/priority-species.html).

- The source data can be found in "02_raw data". 

- All of the R code used to create the list can be found in "01_code".

- The audience for this code and final report are general scientits working in the field of ecology with no coding or data science experience. They should be able to follow the thought process even if they cannot follow the coding.

Please feel free to message me with any questions, comments, feedback, etc.

thanks for checking it out!
